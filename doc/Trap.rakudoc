=head1 DESCRIPTION

Trap exports a class C<Trap> that can be called to capture standard
output and/or standard error, typically for a lexical scope.

The class can be called with either one or two arguments, each of which
should be a writeable local dynamic variable C<$*OUT> or C<$*ERR>. Or one
can create the C<Trap> object manually.  Or one can use C<Trap> to just
trap the standard output and/or standard error (see SYNOPSIS for examples).

Note that if you're only interested in surpressing output from B<warnings>,
you should use the C<quietly> statement prefix.
